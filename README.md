## Background
Once I found out about the wonderful world of APIs, I knew right away that I wanted to work with news data.

I don't follow the news at all really, but news data, particularly news articles, are rich in text, have titles, and images. 

### Why the New York Times?
No reason in-particular, though I must say I am quite happy with the decision.

The heart of this app is the archives search:
> The Archive API provides lists of NYT articles by month going back to 1851. Simply pass in the year and month you want and it returns a JSON object with all articles for that month.
