## Background
Once I found out about the wonderful world of APIs, I knew right away that I wanted to work with news data.

I don't follow the news at all, but news data, particularly news articles, have a simple data-structure of title, text, and perhaps a few images. This was an ideal schema for me, as I wanted data that would be easy to build a UI around. 

### Why the New York Times?
No reason in-particular, though I must say I am quite happy with the decision.

The heart of this app is the archives search:
> The Archive API provides lists of NYT articles by month going back to 1851. Simply pass in the year and month you want and it returns a JSON object with all articles for that month.

Reading old news articles is a very interesting experience to say the least. I won't wax poetic too much here, but I feel it's the closest thing we have to a time machine.
